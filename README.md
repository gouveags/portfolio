## Want to know more about this project?

Curious about the design decisions behind this project? Maybe you're wondering:

- **Why choose old tech like HTML + CSS + JavaScript over React?**
- **Why such a clean, minimal design without fancy animations?**
- **Where is the youtube video where you coppied this project from?** (spoiler: Nowhere! **it's all original code here!**)

[Here](./docs/DESIGN_CHOICES.md) I'll be docummenting a little about some of the design choices I've made for this project and why they matter (at least to me). Go check out and then let's talk about it!
